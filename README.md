Overview:    
-My newest version on AvK( my library for Deep learning, you can think of it like a meme copy of Tensorflow or Pytorch ).   
-This time, I added tons more things compared to the old version in HM_GPT.  
-With roughly 2500 lines of code, I used it for Convolutional Neural Networks and Beta-Variational-Autoencoder.   
-I added a lot of comments, documents, and overviews of every file.   

How to use it?    
-Run the Beta_VAE.py file for Beta-Variational-Autoencoder.   
-Run the CNN.py file for Convolutional Neural Network.  
-But the main application is actually the SUPER_AVK file, it has all my newest implementations for a Deep learning library.   
-You should only use it for learning cause it may not be efficient for real-life projects.
